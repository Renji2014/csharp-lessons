Modify the Hello World prorgamm given in the slides and programmed in the first exercise to calculate the eudlidean distance.[^solution]

[^solution]:    
    You can find the solution to this task [Here](https://github.com/satkowski/csharp-solutions/blob/master/lesson_01/A01_euclidean_distance/ExerciseSolution/).

### Step 1

Create variables to hold the values for the different coordinates of two points. These two points are two dimensional.

### Step 2

Calculate the euclidean distance[^euclidian_distance] from the given points/coordinates.

[^euclidian_distance]:
    [Wikipedia site](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euklidischer_Abstand) for euclidean distance calculation
    
*Hint: We need to use the square root function.*[^sqrt]

[^sqrt]:
    [MSDN site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.math.sqrt%28v=vs.90%29.aspx) for `Math.Sqrt()`

### Step 3

Write your solution on the console and verify that it worked correctly.
